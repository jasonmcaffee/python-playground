Lower per-use costs than pay as you go plans.</li><li><strong>Custom (aka Scale)</strong> – minimum spend (typically $500/month) and annual commitment but lower per-use costs than pay as you go or growth plans.  Minimums can apply across the entire Plaid account or by product. </li></ul><p>For customers based in Europe, only Custom plans are offered. In addition, Payment Initiation, Signal, and Transfer are currently offered only via Custom plans.</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#pricing-information"><h4>Pricing information<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="pricing-information"></span></h4></a><p>To view the exact pricing you may be eligible for, <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview/production" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apply for Production access</a>.  Pricing information for pay-as-you-go and growth plans will be displayed on the last page before you submit your access request.  For exact pricing details for scale plans, select the scale pricing option on the last page, and Sales will get in touch to inform you what volume discounts you may be eligible for.  Or, you can <a href="https://plaid.com/contact/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact Sales</a> via the contact form.</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#pricing-models"><h4>Pricing models<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="pricing-models"></span></h4></a><p>Plaid has multiple different pricing models, depending on the product. These models only apply to Production traffic; usage of Sandbox and Development environments is always free.</p><p>Note that the details outlined below are general information and guidance about typical pricing structures and policies for new customers. Your specific pricing and billing structure is governed by your agreement with Plaid. If you have questions about your bill, <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/account-administration/pricing" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact Support</a>.</p><p>Endpoints that are not associated with any particular product are generally available to Plaid customers free of charge. Examples of these free-to-use endpoints include <a href="/docs/api/institutions/">Institutions endpoints</a>, <a href="/docs/api/items/">Item endpoints</a>, <a href="/docs/api/accounts/#accountsget"><code>/accounts/get</code></a> (not to be confused with <a href="/docs/api/products/balance/#accountsbalanceget"><code>/accounts/balance/get</code></a>, which is associated with the Balance product), and <a href="/docs/api/tokens/">token management endpoints</a>.</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#one-time-fee"><h5>One-time fee<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="one-time-fee"></span></h5></a><p>You will incur charges for one-time fee products whenever an Item is initialized with that product. This occurs when an Item has been successfully created by Link and this product was included in Link's product array. An Item is considered successfully created if an <code>access_token</code> was generated. If the Item was not initialized with the product at the time of creation, it can also be initialized later by calling a product endpoint belonging to that product on the Item. </p><p>For Document Income and Payroll Income, charges will be incurred when data is available to be accessed. This will typically be indicated by the <code>INCOME_VERIFICATION</code> webhook firing with the status of <code>VERIFICATION_STATUS_PROCESSING_COMPLETE</code>. </p><p>When using Transfer, each Item initialized with Transfer will incur the one-time Auth fee, and no additional fee will be incurred for using Auth endpoints with that Item. </p><p>For one-time fee products, it does not matter how many API calls are made for the Item; the cost is the same regardless of whether the product's endpoints are called many times or zero times. </p><p>Products that use one-time fee pricing are: Auth, Identity, and Income.</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#subscription-fee"><h5>Subscription fee<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="subscription-fee"></span></h5></a><p>The subscription fee model is similar to the one-time fee model, except that the Item will incur a monthly subscription fee as long as it exists, even if API calls cannot be successfully made for the Item. Removing the Item will end the subscription. Once an Item has been initialized with a subscription fee product, it is not possible to end the subscription without removing the Item via <a href="/docs/api/items/#itemremove"><code>/item/remove</code></a>. Plaid's subscription cycle is based on calendar months in the UTC time zone; each month begins a new cycle. Fees for Items created or removed in the middle of the month are not pro-rated.</p><p>Products that use subscription fee pricing are: Transactions (except for the <a href="/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh"><code>/transactions/refresh</code></a> endpoint), Liabilities, and Investments.</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee"><h5>Per-request flat fee<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="per-request-flat-fee"></span></h5></a><p>For per-request flat fee products, a flat fee is charged for each successful API call to that product endpoint.</p><p>Products and endpoints that use per-request flat fee pricing are: Balance (<a href="/docs/api/products/balance/#accountsbalanceget"><code>/accounts/balance/get</code></a>), <a href="/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh"><code>/transactions/refresh</code></a>, <a href="/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportaudit_copycreate"><code>/asset_report/audit_copy/create</code></a>, <a href="/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportpdfget"><code>/asset_report/pdf/get</code></a>, and Signal (<a href="/docs/api/products/signal/#signalevaluate"><code>/signal/evaluate</code></a>).</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flexible-fee"><h5>Per-request flexible fee<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="per-request-flexible-fee"></span></h5></a><p>For per-request flexible fee products, a fee is charged for each successful API call to that product endpoint. The fee will vary depending on the amount of information requested in the API request. </p><p>Products that use per-request flexible fee pricing are: Assets (pricing depends on number of days of transaction history requested and quantity of Items in the Asset Report) and Enrich (pricing depends on quantity of transactions sent for enrichment). </p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#per-payment-fee"><h5>Per-payment fee<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="per-payment-fee"></span></h5></a><p>For per-payment fee products, a fee is charged for each payment initiated with the product. A payment is considered initiated if the end user reached the end of the payment flow and received a confirmation success screen. Standing orders (recurring payments) are considered a single payment but are billed on a separate pricing schedule from one-time payments. Fees will vary depending on the network used to transfer the payment. </p><p>The per-payment fee is charged even if the payment is later reversed or clawed back. In such cases, a reversed payment fee may be charged as well.</p><p>When using Transfer, each Item initialized with Transfer will also be initialized with Auth and will incur a one-time Auth fee in addition to the per-payment Transfer fee.</p><p>Products that use per-payment fee pricing are: Payment Initiation (UK and Europe), Transfer, and Transfer UI.</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#monitor-fee-model"><h5>Monitor fee model<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="monitor-fee-model"></span></h5></a><p>Monitor uses a model with two fees:</p><ul><li>A base fee, which is incurred the first time a new user is scanned</li><li>A rescanning fee, which is incurred based on the number of users rescanned each month </li></ul><p>The rescanning fee is calculated based on the number of users on a rescanning program in a given month and works similarly to the subscription fee model. Plaid's subscription cycle is based on calendar months in the UTC time zone; each month begins a new cycle. Fees for users added to or removed from a rescanning program in the middle of the month are not pro-rated.</p><p>To avoid being rebilled for a user you no longer need recurring scans for (e.g., a user who has closed their account with you), create a program specifically for former users, make sure rescans are disabled, and move the user into that program when they are offboarded from your system.</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#identity-verification-fee-model"><h5>Identity Verification fee model<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="identity-verification-fee-model"></span></h5></a><p>For Identity Verification, a fee is charged based on the end user performing certain activities during the Link flow. The following events are billed:</p><ul><li>Base check (the first verification check run, typically when the end user enters their phone number to begin SMS verification. If this is skipped, the base check fee will be incurred later on. For example, if the SMS check is skipped in favor of the document check, the document check will incur both the base check fee and the document check fee.)</li><li>Lightning verification (cost varies based on the end user's country, see your pricing contract for details)</li><li>Document check</li><li>Selfie check </li></ul><p>If a retry is issued for a session, the retry will be billed like a new session, including the base check and any other verification checks included in the retried session.</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#partnerships-pricing"><h4>Partnerships pricing<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="partnerships-pricing"></span></h4></a><p>If you are using a Plaid partner, you will be charged for Plaid API usage performed by the partner using your processor token in the same way as if the calls had been made by you. If you have questions about the partner's API activity, contact the Plaid partner.</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#viewing-billable-activity-and-invoices"><h4>Viewing billable activity and invoices<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="viewing-billable-activity-and-invoices"></span></h4></a><p>To view billable activity for your account, see the <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/activity/usage" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Usage</a> page on the developer dashboard.</p><p>Invoices will be sent each month to the <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/settings/company/profile" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">billing contact</a> configured for the team.</p><a href="/docs/account/billing/#updating-payment-information"><h4>Updating payment information<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="updating-payment-information"></span></h4></a><p>Pay as you go customers can update <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/settings/team/billing" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">payment method</a> and <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/settings/company/profile" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">billing contact</a> information on the developer dashboard.
