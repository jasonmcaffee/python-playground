ACH uses bank account details (account and routing numbers) to facilitate bank-to-bank transfers. The organization that governs ACH is known as <a href="https://www.nacha.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nacha</a>.</p><p>This article outlines ACH details you will need to know for your Transfers implementation: Nacha requirements for providing messaging to your end users, processing windows and cutoffs for initiating ACH transfers, and how to handle ACH returns.</p><a href="/docs/transfer/ach/#ach-authorization-requirements"><h4>ACH authorization requirements<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="ach-authorization-requirements"></span></h4></a><p>In accordance with Nacha Rules, you must obtain appropriate authorization from the owner of the bank account before initiating an ACH payment via Transfer. As the Originator of the transaction, it is your sole responsibility to (1) verify the identity of your customer; (2) determine their eligibility to purchase your products or services; and (3) obtain appropriate authorization to initiate ACH debits from or ACH credits to their account.</p><p>We recommend that you both follow the steps below and store information (such as user flow screenshots and activity logs) showing that you have done so. This information should be stored (in physical or digital format) for at least 2 years since the most recent authorized payment made by a customer. Note that the guidance given here is general; refer to the Nacha Rules to ensure you are complying with your obligations.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Customer consent</strong> – Provide an authorization page that clearly states you are obtaining the customer’s consent to debit their bank account for a particular transaction or for recurring transactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transaction-specific information</strong> – Collect the date and time of the transaction, account information of debited account, item or service purchased, frequency of payment (if recurring), and IP address.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customer account information</strong> – Collect the name on the account, shipping details (if applicable), and any other ways to verify the customer’s identity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transaction receipt</strong> – Provide the customer a receipt of the transaction by sending them an e-mail receipt of the transaction and also giving them the ability to print the authorization to retain a copy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Process to revoke authorization</strong> – Include a telephone number and e-mail address where your customer can contact you to do so, which should be on the authorization page and in the receipt.</p></li></ol><div><i><svg aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M12.75 16h-1.5v-5h1.5zM12 8a1 1 0 101 1 1 1 0 00-1-1zm8.75 4A8.75 8.75 0 1012 20.75 8.77 8.77 0 0020.75 12zm-1.5 0A7.25 7.25 0 1112 4.75 7.26 7.26 0 0119.25 12z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></i><div><p>  Plaid Transfer UI provides out-of-the-box authorization language and a payments UX designed in accordance with the applicable authorization rules.

For a same-day transfer, the cutoff time is 3:30PM Eastern Time. For a next-day transfer, the cutoff time is 5:30PM Eastern Time. It is recommended to submit a transfer at least 15 minutes before the cutoff time to guarantee that it will be processed before the cutoff.</p><p>Note that same-day transfers submitted after 3:30PM Eastern Time and before 5:30PM Eastern Time will be automatically updated to be next-day and submitted to the network in that following ACH processing window. This update also applies to the sweep. This process minimizes the risk of return due to insufficient funds by reducing the delay between Plaid's balance check and the submission of the transfer to the ACH network. The settlement time remains the same as it would have been if the transfer had been submitted in next same-day window.</p><p>ACH processing windows are active only on banking days. Transfers will not be submitted to the network on weekends or bank holidays. Keep this in mind when creating transfers over weekends or on bank holidays. To mitigate, wait until the next banking day and then authorize and create the transfer.</p><p>Some accounts are subject to ACH processing hold times in order to reduce risk. If your account is subject to a hold, your Account Manager will inform you. Any hold will take place in between when funds are swept and the credit or debit to the consumer's account.</p><a href="/docs/transfer/ach/#ach-returns"><h4>ACH returns<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="ach-returns"></span></h4></a><p>After a payment has been posted, a payment can be returned and clawed back from your account for a multitude of reasons. For example, a bank could determine that there are insufficient funds to complete the transfer, or a consumer can contact their bank and flag the transaction as unauthorized. If a transfer results in an ACH return, the funds will be automatically clawed back. In the event of an ACH return, we suggest you message the reversal to your user.</p><p>For a full list of all ACH return codes you may encounter, see <a href="/docs/errors/transfer/#ach-return-codes">ACH return codes</a>.</p><a href="/docs/transfer/ach/#most-common-ach-return-codes"><h5>Most common ACH return codes<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="most-common-ach-return-codes"></span></h5></a><h6 id="r01---insufficient-funds">R01 - Insufficient funds</h6><p>This occurs if there are insufficient funds in the account. This return code is highly mitigated by the Transfer authorization engine, but you may see this return code if the authorization engine returns <code>permitted</code> and you still create the transfer. See <a href="/docs/api/products/transfer/#transfer-authorization-create-response-authorization">Transfer decision authorization</a> for more information.</p><p>If you are submitting the transfer on a Friday, we recommend using same-day ACH to decrease the likelihood of the user’s account balance dipping below the transfer amount over the weekend.</p><p>If you encounter an R01 return code, you can resubmit the payment.</p><h6 id="r03---no-account-or-unable-to-locate-account">R03 - No account or unable to locate account</h6><p>This can occur for one of the following reasons:</p><ul><li><p>The account number doesn’t correspond to the individual’s information passed into the <code>user</code> object in either the <a href="/docs/api/products/transfer/#transferauthorizationcreate"><code>/transfer/authorization/create</code></a> or <a href="/docs/api/products/transfer/#transfercreate"><code>/transfer/create</code></a> endpoints</p></li><li><p>The <code>account_id</code> passed to the <a href="/docs/api/products/transfer/#transferauthorizationcreate"><code>/transfer/authorization/create</code></a> or <a href="/docs/api/products/transfer/#transfercreate"><code>/transfer/create</code></a> endpoints is not an open account</p></li></ul><p>This could happen if the user closed the account in the time between linking their account and creation of the transfer.</p><p>If you encounter an R03 return code, prompt the user to link another account via Plaid Link and use this newly linked account to create the transfer.</p><h6 id="r10---customer-advises-not-authorized">R10 - Customer advises not authorized</h6><p>This can occur if the customer advises their bank that the payment you initiated is unauthorized. According to Nacha rules, these occurrences must be kept below 50 basis points.</p><p>Make sure you add proper web debit authorization language (for best practices, see <a href="/docs/transfer/ach/#ach-authorization-requirements">ACH authorization requirements</a>) to your "pay with bank" UX to protect against exposure of returns of over 60 days. If you don’t have proper web debit authorization language, you are exposed to returns of up to 1 year.</p><p>Unlike other ACH return codes, you cannot resubmit a payment after encountering an R10 error.</p><a href="/docs/transfer/ach/#ach-return-timing"><h5>ACH return timing<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="ach-return-timing"></span></h5></a><p>Each ACH return code has a maximum window of time during which funds can be clawed back. For example, for some ACH return codes, the window of time is two banking days. The following is to give you a general idea of when returns typically occur, regardless of the specific ACH return code:</p><ul><li>50% of ACH returns occur by day 2 of submitting to the Nacha network</li><li>90% of ACH returns occur by day 4 of submitting to the Nacha network</li><li>95% of ACH returns occur by day 5 of submitting to the Nacha network</li><li>99% of ACH returns occur by day 8 of submitting to the Nacha network</li></ul></main></div></div></div></div><next-route-announcer><p aria-live="assertive" id="__next-route-announcer__" role="alert"></p></next-route-announcer><iframe height="0" id="universal_pixel_u0iai2i" src="https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/up?adv=4azo4ri&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fplaid.com%2Fdocs%2Ftransfer%2Fach%2F&amp;upid=u0iai2i&amp;upv=1.1.0" title="TTD Universal Pixel" width="0"></iframe><div id="batBeacon142928199451"><img alt="" height="0" id="batBeacon411941575698" src="https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=25047304&amp;Ver=2&amp;mid=2d11ea90-7834-4410-96fe-97d4eda339fb&amp;sid=839d8000406811ee9647031f9910d79d&amp;vid=839d8d20406811ee8b5bc59b5329b4ac&amp;vids=0&amp;msclkid=N&amp;pi=0&amp;lg=en-US&amp;sw=5120&amp;sh=1440&amp;sc=24&amp;nwd=1&amp;tl=Transfer%20-%20ACH%20requirements%20%7C%20Plaid%20Docs&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fplaid.com%2Fdocs%2Ftransfer%2Fach%2F&amp;r=&amp;lt=804&amp;evt=pageLoad&amp;sv=1&amp;rn=360998" width="0"/><img alt="" height="0" id="batBeacon876505714563" src="https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=25047304&amp;Ver=2&amp;mid=2d11ea90-7834-4410-96fe-97d4eda339fb&amp;sid=839d8000406811ee9647031f9910d79d&amp;vid=839d8d20406811ee8b5bc59b5329b4ac&amp;vids=0&amp;msclkid=N&amp;ea=track&amp;el=DOCS_EVENT&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fplaid.com%2Fdocs%2Ftransfer%2Fach%2F&amp;sw=5120&amp;sh=1440&amp;sc=24&amp;nwd=1&amp;evt=custom&amp;rn=244850" width="0"/></div><div>
