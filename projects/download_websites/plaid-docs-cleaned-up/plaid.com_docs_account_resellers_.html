The possible statuses are described below:</p><ul><li><code>UNDER REVIEW</code>: You successfully created the End Customer, but more information is needed before Plaid can approve or deny them. This status is most commonly seen when the newly created End Customer is already a Plaid customer, in which case you will need to talk with your Partner Account Manager to resolve the channel conflict.</li><li><code>DENIED</code>: You successfully created the End Customer, but Plaid has determined that we cannot service them through your reseller contract. This status is most commonly seen in the case of channel conflicts (i.e., Plaid already has a contract with this End Customer).</li><li><code>PENDING ENABLEMENT</code>: You successfully created the End Customer and Plaid has approved them. You may now enable the End Customer (see the next section, <a href="/docs/account/resellers/#enabling-end-customers">Enabling End Customers</a>, for details on the enablement process).</li><li><code>ACTIVE</code>: You successfully created and enabled the End Customer.

This allows you to test your End Customers prior to enabling them in Production. It also prevents you from accidentally incurring billable activity prior to launching with your End Customers.</p><p>To enable an End Customer, click on their team in the <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Overview</a> page and then click <strong>Get production access</strong>.</p><p>Enablement happens instantly. Once the End Customer has been enabled, you will be able to view their Production secret on the <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/developers/keys" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keys</a> page and use it to make API calls to Plaid in the Production environment.</p><p>When you enable an End Customer, Plaid will automatically begin registering them with financial institutions that require OAuth access for connectivity, such as Chase and Capital One. Registration at most institutions happens within 24 hours, but for some institutions it may take several weeks. You can check the registration status for all OAuth institutions via the <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/settings/compliance/us-oauth-institutions" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OAuth institutions</a> page for a given End Customer.</p><p>Alternatively, you can set up a webhook in the dashboard to get automatically notified when an End Customer has their OAuth status updated. To configure the webhook, go to the <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/developers/webhooks" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">webhooks page</a> and create a new webhook listening to the <strong>End Customer OAuth status updated</strong> event type. For details on the webhook, see the <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/api/partner/#partner_end_customer_oauth_status_updated" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partner API documentation</a>.</p><p>If you encounter errors during OAuth registration, contact your Partner Account Manager for help.</p><a href="/docs/account/resellers/#deleting-end-customers"><h4>Deleting End Customers<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="deleting-end-customers"></span></h4></a><p>In some cases you may wish to delete an End Customer prior to enabling them for Production, possibly because they were created in error or because they are no longer working with you.</p><p>To delete an End Customer, go to the <a href="https://dashboard.plaid.com/personal/teams" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Teams</a> page, click on the three dots next to the End Customer's name, and then click <strong>Delete team</strong>:</p><div></div><p>Deleting the End Customer will immediately deactivate their API keys and remove them from view in the Dashboard.
