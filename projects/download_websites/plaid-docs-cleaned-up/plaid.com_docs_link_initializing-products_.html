This choice impacts which products you will be billed for, the latency of Link initialization, and which institutions your user can connect to. You can choose whether initialize Link with all of your products or to defer initializing some of those products until later. You can also use the <a href="/docs/link/initializing-products/#required-if-supported-products">Required if Suppported Products</a> feature to conditionally initialize certain products.</p><p>In general, it is recommended to initialize Link with the minimal set of products you need. </p><a href="/docs/link/initializing-products/#initializing-products-post-link"><h4>Initializing products post-Link<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="initializing-products-post-link"></span></h4></a><p>If an Item was not initialized with a given product at the time of Link, making a product endpoint call for information about that Item will automatically initialize the Item with that product. For example, if an Item was not initialized with Transactions during Link, calling <a href="/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync"><code>/transactions/sync</code></a> or <a href="/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget"><code>/transactions/get</code></a> on that Item for the first time will initialize it with the Transactions product. </p><p>Some exceptions exist: Identity Verification and Payment Initiation cannot be initialized post-Link. If you are using <a href="/docs/link/initializing-products/#initializing-link-when-using-data-transparency-messaging">Data Transparency Messaging Beta</a>, you cannot initialize products post-link unless you configure them via <code>additional_consented_products</code>.</p><a href="/docs/link/initializing-products/#impacts-of-initialization-timing-on-billing"><h4>Impacts of initialization timing on billing<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="impacts-of-initialization-timing-on-billing"></span></h4></a><p>If you initialize Link with a product that is billed under an initialization or subscription model, you will be billed when an Item for the product is created, even if you are not yet using the product’s endpoints.</p><p>To avoid unwanted charges, do not initialize Link with a product in Production unless you are sure you are going to use that product. To learn more about how Plaid bills each product, see <a href="/docs/account/billing/">Billing</a>.</p><a href="/docs/link/initializing-products/#impacts-of-initialization-timing-on-conversion"><h4>Impacts of initialization timing on conversion<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="impacts-of-initialization-timing-on-conversion"></span></h4></a><p>The products Link is initialized with will determine which institutions and accounts are available in Link. If Link is initialized with multiple products, only institutions supporting <strong>all</strong> of those products will be available. If the user selects a filtered institution in the Link UI, a "Connectivity not supported" error will appear. In addition, if the user does not have at least one account that is supported by each selected product, products a <code>NO_AUTH_ACCOUNTS</code> or <code>NO_ACCOUNTS</code> error will occur. See the <a href="/docs/api/accounts/#account-type--product-support-matrix">accounts / product support matrix</a> for further details.</p><p>To avoid overly filtering the institution and account list, you can use <a href="/docs/link/initializing-products/#required-if-supported-products">Required if Supported Products</a>, or initialize Link with your required products and call other products’ endpoints later.</p><a href="/docs/link/initializing-products/#impacts-of-initialization-timing-on-latency"><h4>Impacts of initialization timing on latency<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="impacts-of-initialization-timing-on-latency"></span></h4></a><p>Some Plaid products that fetch an extended amount of history, such as Transactions, Investments, and Signal, may require up to a minute or more to fetch all the data that they need the first time that they are initialized for a specific Item. For these products, Plaid begins to prepare data upon Item link if the Item was initialized with the product. If the Item was not initialized with the product during Link, Plaid will only begin to fetch data for that product the first time you call an endpoint belonging to that product, such as <a href="/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync"><code>/transactions/sync</code></a> or <a href="/docs/api/products/signal/#signalprepare"><code>/signal/prepare</code></a>. </p><a href="/docs/link/initializing-products/#required-if-supported-products"><h4>Required if Supported Products<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="required-if-supported-products"></span></h4></a><p>In order to require a secondary product when possible, without excluding users who don't have access to that product from linking their account, you can specify the secondary product in the <code>required_if_supported_products</code> array when calling <a href="/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate"><code>/link/token/create</code></a>. (It is possible to specify multiple products in this field as well, as long as at least one always-required product is specified in the regular <code>products</code> array.)</p><p>When a product is listed in <code>required_if_supported_products</code>, Plaid will require that product if possible. If the institution the end user is attempting to link supports the secondary product, and the user grants Plaid access to an account at the institution that is compatible with it, Plaid will treat the product as though it was listed in the <code>products</code> array. If the institution does not support the product, if the user doesn't have accounts compatible with it, or if the user has compatible accounts but doesn't grant access to them, Plaid will treat the product as though it had not been specified in the <a href="/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate"><code>/link/token/create</code></a> call. (To determine whether a product was successfully added to the Item, you can call <a href="/docs/api/items/#itemget"><code>/item/get</code></a> after obtaining your <code>access_token</code> and look at the value of the <code>products</code> array.)</p><p>For example, if you call <a href="/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate"><code>/link/token/create</code></a> with both Auth and Identity in the <code>products</code> array, a user can only link an account if both Auth and Identity are supported by their institution, and they cannot use flows like Same-day Micro-deposits. However, if you list Auth in <code>products</code> and Identity in <code>required_if_supported_products</code>, users will be able to link checking and savings accounts at any institution that supports Auth, even if the institution does not support Identity. They will also be able to access flows that require Auth to be initialized by itself, like Same-day Micro-deposits. If the institution <em>does</em> support both Auth and Identity, Plaid will attempt to initialize the Item with both products. If the institution has an OAuth flow where Identity access can be configured as a separate permission, and the user does not grant access to Identity, the Link attempt will not complete and the user will be prompted to re-try the Link flow.  </p><p>As another example, if Transactions and Auth are both listed as <code>products</code>, users will only be able to link checking or savings accounts, since a filter is automatically applied whenever Auth is in the <code>products</code> array that limits acceptable accounts to checking and savings accounts. If Transactions is listed in <code>products</code> and Auth is listed in <code>required_if_supported_products</code>, users will be able to link other Transactions-compatible account types, such as credit cards or money market accounts, but if they do link a checking or savings account, Plaid will fetch Auth data for that account. </p><a href="/docs/link/initializing-products/#when-to-use-required-if-supported-products"><h5>When to use Required if Supported Products<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="when-to-use-required-if-supported-products"></span></h5></a><p>If your only reason for initializing Link without a specific product is to increase the number of institutions covered, it is recommended to use the <code>required_if_supported_products</code> field rather than initializing the other product later. Initializing both products during the initial Link will make it easier to obtain all of the consent that is required at institutions that use OAuth, since the user will be prompted to fix their selections during the OAuth flow if they do not grant the required consent for all products. Initializing both products upfront can also reduce latency, since it allows Plaid to begin fetching data immediately and to optimize the order in which different types of data are requested. </p><p>If, on the other hand, you are not initializing with a product upfront because you don't yet know during Link initialization whether you'll need the product, you should not use <code>required_if_supported_products</code> and should initialize with the product post-Link. For example, if your app primarily uses Auth for funds transfers but also offers an optional budgeting add-on that uses Transactions, you should initialize by calling <a href="/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync"><code>/transactions/sync</code></a> only once your user opts in to using the budgeting tool. This will prevent you from being billed for a product before you are sure you need to use it. It will also maximize your Item add success rates, since if Plaid encounters an error extracting data for a Required if Supported Product during Link, the Item add will not complete.</p><p>Not all products can be listed in the <code>required_if_supported_products</code> field.

If the Item has already been created and the product you need is not in the Item's <code>consented_products</code> field (which can be checked by calling <a href="/docs/api/items/#itemget"><code>/item/get</code></a>), you need to obtain additional user consent, which you can do by sending the user through <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/#using-update-mode-to-request-additional-consent-for-products" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">update mode</a> with the <code>products</code> array updated to include the full set of products you would like to obtain consent for. </p><p>Both the <code>additional_consented_products</code> array and update mode methods obtain consent for a product without initializing the Item for that product, avoiding any billing or performance implications.</p><a href="/docs/link/initializing-products/#special-cases-for-link-initialization"><h4>Special cases for Link initialization<span data-algolia="linkedHeadingAnchor" id="special-cases-for-link-initialization"></span></h4></a><p>There are some exceptions to the ability to initialize products by calling their endpoints:</p><ul><li>Bank Income and Assets can both be initialized post-Link, but may require re-launching Link to obtain additional consent.
