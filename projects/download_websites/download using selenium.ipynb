Akoya secures the way consumers provide access to their data with increased security, privacy, and control over their information by transitioning data aggregation toward application programming interface (API)-based data access.\\nRemoves login credentials from data aggregation by implementing tokenized access.\\nFacilitates a consent flow where consumers authenticate, select accounts, and permission data directly with their financial institution.\\nEnsures consumers have control by giving them the ability to monitor and disable access.\\nDoes not store any data accessed or shared on its network.\\nMaintains a pass-through model for complete privacy for all participants. At no point does Akoya know who the consumer is or what data they are sharing.\\nAkoya serves as a data-access utility similar to a trusted delivery service. Akoya delivers the package (data) between a financial institution and a fintech app. Akoya does not open the package, does not make a copy of what is inside, analyze it, or store it for future use. Akoya simply gets the package safely from point A to point B.\\nFeatures\\nConsent flow\\nThe consent flow enables a customer to authenticate, select accounts, and permission data to flow from their data provider through the Data Access Network and to a third-party fintech app. This keeps your customers’ login credentials from being shared with third parties.\\nTip: You may click on images to view in full screen\\nEmily wants to connect a fintech app to her financial institution accounts, in this example, at her fictional bank, Mikomo.\\nEmily is redirected by the fintech app to Akoya where the fintech and Mikomo ids are validated.\\nAkoya initiates an auth grant code to Mikomo Bank and Emily authenticates at the Mikomo Bank site.\\nEmily agrees to terms and conditions and gives authorization to provide access of her data to her fintech app.\\nMikomo Bank issues an authorization grant code to Akoya who in turn requests the Mikomo Bank access token.\\nUsing Mikomo Bank’s token, Akoya requests Emily’s account list for selection and permissioning to her fintech app. Emily approves account selection.\\nAkoya redirects Emily back to her fintech app with the Akoya auth code.\\nThe Akoya auth code is exchanged by the fintech app for an Akoya ID token. The fintech app uses the Akoya token to request Emily’s account details. Akoya then uses Mikomo Bank’s token to request\\npermissioned data.\\nMikomo Bank returns data to Akoya. Akoya gets the entitlements policy and applies Mikomo Bank’s rules. Akoya returns the data to the fintech app.\\nEmily sees the permissioned account data.\\nAkoya API v2\\nAkoya API v2\\nBased on Financial Data Exchange (FDX) specifications, the Akoya API v2 allows recipients to request consumer-permissioned data to flow from a provider through the Data Access Network.\\nThrough data mapping and API integration, Akoya translates responses from providers—even those with proprietary APIs—into a common format. Expected and standard API responses help mitigate the need for proprietary APIs, thereby reducing development costs.\\nConnection Management\\nAkoya apps: Data Recipient Hub and Management Console\\nThe Management Console is available for data providers to self-manage their connections and configure their settings in the Akoya Data Access Network.\\nAkoya also provides aggregators and fintechs with the Data Recipient Hub to manage their connection to providers.\\nPermission API\\nThe Akoya Permission API is used by a data provider to add support to their customer experience for Akoya account permission management.\\nBy making calls to the API, a provider can add a permission dashboard that allows their consumers to see which recipients have access to their permissioned data, add new accounts, remove accounts, or remove access overall.\\nAbout Akoya security and technology\\nFDX+ is the primary API interface for data recipients. All APIs are RESTful.\\nOIDC, OAuth 2.0, and SAML are implemented for authorization and authentication.\\nComplete logging, auditability, and traceability.\\nDifferent logging capabilities available.\\nCloud-native implementation on AWS that enables elastic scaling in real-time.\\nMicro-services architecture that enables continuous application upgrades and cloud scalability.\\nStrong in-flight and at-rest encryption.\\nLeast Privilege Zero-Trust Model.\\nSecure application development implementing DevSecOps.\\nNIST and FFIEC frameworks are leveraged to define and prioritize risks.\\nAkoya is SOC 2/Type 2 certified.\\nUpdated 6 months ago\\nAkoya API v2\\nHow to work with Akoya\\nDid this page help you?\\nYes\\nNo\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nFeatures\\nConsent flow\\nAkoya API v2\\nConnection Management\\nPermission API\\nAbout Akoya security and technology\\n© 2023 Akoya.

This document is intended to help data recipients currently using v1 to migrate to v2.\\nMigration considerations\\nOverview\\nChanges you may need to make to migrate to Akoya API v2:\\nVersioning support. Akoya limits breaking changes to major API versions. To reduce the need for large, breaking-change updates, Akoya will continue to improve its products by releasing minor updates on a continual basis. These minor updates are non-breaking, backward-compatible improvements. When migrating to Akoya API v2, please plan for these minor version updates and implement in a way to allow for these non-breaking changes. Please see the versioning guide for more details.\\nTransaction pagination. With Akoya API v1, paging through transaction data could require different implementations per provider. To standardize paging, we’ve introduced link-based pagination. All paging implementations from Akoya API v1 will need to be migrated to using Akoya-generated links instead. For more information, see: Link-based pagination.\\nEndpoint path names. Akoya has introduced products to allow a more streamlined approach to data access. To support our new products, all new endpoints include the Akoya version in the path and no longer include the FDX version. We’ve also named the endpoints to more closely coincide with our products rather than using a single FDX /accounts endpoint. For example, if your use case requires balance data, the endpoint will now be: https://products.ddp.akoya.com/balances/v2/. For a full list of endpoints, see: [Endpoint summary] (#endpoint-summary \"Endpoint summary\")\\nData element support.\\nIn the near future, to support our new products, the following data elements will no longer be available through the Akoya API v1 /accounts endpoint. However, these data elements will be available in the Payments product:\\naccountNumber\\nroutingTransitNumber\\nData elements available through the Akoya API v1 /accounts details calls will now be available through either the Accounts info, Balances, or Investment products. Please consider your use case to determine which products will continue to provide the data your app requires.\\nAs a general guide, detailed data for all account categories except investment accounts can be retrieved through the Balances product.

Implement consent flow, token retrieval, and data requests all using the Akoya sandbox.\\nSuggest Edits\\nThe Akoya sandbox allows you to make calls to Akoya APIs for tokens and data.\\nEvery data request in the Data Access Network requires an ID token. To test in sandbox, you must log in as a user and complete the account selection and consent flow process to retrieve an ID token. Akoya has provided a mock data provider for your testing use.\\nMikomo Financial\\nMikomo Financial, the Akoya mock data provider, is the only provider available in sandbox. Mikomo includes a test library with representative samples from various data providers. The data available from these users is detailed in the Catalog below.\\nWe recommend using Postman for testing. For more information on using Postman, see: Postman collection\\nSandbox requires the following parameters for Akoya API v2:\\nParameter Value\\nclient_id, client_secret, redirect_uri your variable values\\nconnector\\nnote: the connector parameter is the same as the providerId mikomo\\nidp_url sandbox-idp.ddp.akoya.com\\npermission_url sandbox-permission.api.ddp.akoya.com\\nproducts_url sandbox-products.ddp.akoya.com\\nproviderId mikomo\\nCatalog\\nMikomo users are created with static, example response payloads. These payloads are representative and can be used to understand the type of data you may receive through the Data Access Network.

Based on the FDX specification, it includes accounts and transactions endpoints.\\nMikomo: Akoya’s mock data provider, Mikomo can be used in Sandbox to test against representative responses from all data providers live on the DAN.\\nPermission API: The Akoya Permission API allows a data provider to create or support a permission dashboard for its end-users.\\nSandbox: A dedicated test environment, Sandbox allows recipients to make real calls to Akoya token and data access endpoints. The only data provider available in Sandbox is Mikomo.\\nx-akoya-interaction-id: An autogenerated interaction identifier, the x-akoya-interaction-id is returned in the header of each call, unique to each request, and used as a trace ID for troubleshooting.\\nData Access\\nClient ID: Public identifier of an app.\\nClient secret: Private identifier of an app used during authentication of an API.\\nConsumer: An individual or representative acting on behalf of an individual with ownership rights to the data and transactional capabilities at a data provider.\\nData aggregator: Entities that obtain consumer financial data from data providers.\\nData provider: A financial institution, like a bank, investment firm, or other organization which provides financial services to consumers.\\nData recipient: A third-party, like a data aggregator or fintech company, which processes financial data on behalf a consumer.\\nFinancial Data Exchange (FDX): A nonprofit dedicated to unifying the financial industry around a common, interoperable, royalty-free standard for the secure access of consumer and business financial data. For more information, see our Introduction to FDX.\\nScreen scraping: When a customer gives their user name and password to a third-party, usually a data aggregator, to log in as that consumer, and extract information to populate its service. With these credentials, a third-party has the same access to an account as the customer themselves. This means that customers lack control over the scope or even duration of access they give to a third-party.\\nAuthorization, Authentication, and Tokens\\nAuthentication: Process of obtaining credentials from a user to verify the user\\'s identity.\\nAuthorization: Process of granting access rights to an authenticated entity.\\nAuthorization code: Temporary code that the data recipient (data aggregator or fintech company) will exchange for an ID token. In Akoya\\'s testing environment, the authorization code is valid for 5 minutes.\\nID token: An OIDC security token which contains the user’s authentication information in a JSON Web Token (JWT). JWT is a standardized, validated and/or encrypted container format used to securely transfer data between two parties. For more information, see our Token explainer. In Akoya’s testing environment, the ID token is valid for 30 minutes.\\nOAuth: An open standard for token-based authorization protocol on the internet. It enables apps to obtain limited access to a user’s data using a token instead of a user’s password. The token grants access to just the information a consumer has authorized for a specific app.\\nOpenID Connect (OIDC): An identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It defines a sign-in flow that enables a client application to authenticate a user and to obtain information (or \"claims\") about that user, such as the user name and email. User identity information is encoded in a secure JSON Web Token (JWT).\\nRedirect URI: The location (typically in your application) where users are sent after they authenticate successfully with their financial institutions.\\nRefresh token: A token used to get a new set of refresh and ID tokens when the ID token expires or becomes invalid.\\nAPI Terminology\\nAPI: Acronym for Application Programming Interface. APIs let applications (and devices) seamlessly connect and communicate securely.\\ncURL: Tool to transfer data from or to a server using one of the supported protocols.\\nEndpoint: Specifies where resources are located that can be accessed by third party software. Usually access is via a URI to which HTTP requests are posted and from which the response is expected.\\nHeader: A user defined HTTP header which carries information about a request in a REST call.\\nHTTP Verbs: The 4 basic HTTP verbs Akoya use sin requests to interact with resources in a REST system:\\nGET — retrieve a specific resource (by id) or a collection of resources\\nPOST — create a new resource\\nPUT — update a specific resource (by id)\\nDELETE — remove a specific resource by id\\nREST (or Representational State Transfer): An architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. In brief, in the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).\\nUniform Resource Identifier (URI): A string of characters that refers to a resource. The most common are URLs, which identify the resource by giving its location on the web.\\nUpdated 8 months ago\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nAkoya\\nData Access\\nAuthorization, Authentication, and Tokens\\nAPI Terminology\\n© 2023 Akoya.

Without the same-origin policy, it would be much easier for malicious websites to access resources from remote servers. Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) allows a back end web resource to allow incoming requests from specific external sources.\\nWhen testing through a locally-stored version of our OpenAPI spec, through JavaScript in a browser, or some other testing scenarios, Akoya endpoints may return a CORS error: No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present on the requested resource.
