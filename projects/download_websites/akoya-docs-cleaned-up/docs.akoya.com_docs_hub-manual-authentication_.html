<p>Akoya offers two user authentication options for the <em>Hub </em>: </p>
<ul>
<li>password-based authentication + MFA (and a biometric option) via our own identity provider (IDP). This is the "default" option.</li>
<li>single sign-on (SSO) via identity federation between the <em>Hub</em> and your company's IDP such as Active Directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Akoya-hosted accounts (the first option) are managed entirely within Team management in the <em>Hub</em>. Currently, only the admin role is available for these accounts.</p>
<p>Federated accounts (the second option) are completely managed by your company, as all user accounts and groups "live" in your IDP. Both the admin and viewer roles are available to these accounts. </p>
<p>Please reach out to your customer service manager (CSM) if you're interested in setting up identity federation to access the <em>Hub</em>. Akoya will work with you to set up the integration and to map our two user roles (admin and viewer) to the appropriate security groups on your end. Once integration is complete, you'll manage access to the <em>Hub </em> simply by adding/removing users from the appropriate security groups.</p></div><hr/><div><div data-testid="RDMD"></div><ul><li><a href="/docs/hub-manual-team-management" target="_self">Team management</a><span><svg data-name="arrow-right" fill="none" role="img" viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M5 12h14M12 5l7 7-7 7" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></span></li></ul></div></section><section></section></div><div id="tutorialmodal-root"></div></article></div></main><div id="ChatGPT-modal"></div></div></div><div></div></body>
