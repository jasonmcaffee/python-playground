      "verse_text is:When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.\n",

      "verse_text is:Then the LORD God said to the woman, \"What is this you have done?\" And the woman said, \"The serpent deceived me, and I ate.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:The LORD God said to the serpent, \"Because you have done this, Cursed are you more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you will go, And dust you will eat All the days of your life;\n",
      "verse_text is:And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise him on the heel.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:To the woman He said, \"I will greatly multiply Your pain in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for your husband, And he will rule over you.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then to Adam He said, \"Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat from it'; Cursed is the ground because of you; In toil you will eat of it All the days of your life.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you; And you will eat the plants of the field;\n",

      "verse_text is:Now the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all the living.\n",
      "verse_text is:The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the LORD God said, \"Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever\"--\n",
      "verse_text is:therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken.\n",
      "verse_text is:So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now the man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and she said, \"I have gotten a manchild with the help of the LORD.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Again, she gave birth to his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\n",
      "verse_text is:So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the LORD of the fruit of the ground.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering;\n",
      "verse_text is:but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the LORD said to Cain, \"Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen?\n",
      "verse_text is:\"If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must master it.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Cain told Abel his brother. And it came about when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the LORD said to Cain, \"Where is Abel your brother?\" And he said, \"I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?\"\n",
      "verse_text is:He said, \"What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to Me from the ground.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Cain said to the LORD, \"My punishment is too great to bear!\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Behold, You have driven me this day from the face of the ground; and from Your face I will be hidden, and I will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So the LORD said to him, \"Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.\" And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, so that no one finding him would slay him.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.\n",

      "verse_text is:Adam had relations with his wife again; and she gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, for, she said, \"God has appointed me another offspring in place of Abel, for Cain killed him.\"\n",

      "verse_text is:Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).\n",
      "verse_text is:And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High.\n",
      "verse_text is:He blessed him and said, \"Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth;\n",
      "verse_text is:And blessed be God Most High, Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.\" He gave him a tenth of all.\n",
      "verse_text is:The king of Sodom said to Abram, \"Give the people to me and take the goods for yourself.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abram said to the king of Sodom, \"I have sworn to the LORD God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,\n",
      "verse_text is:that I will not take a thread or a sandal thong or anything that is yours, for fear you would say, 'I have made Abram rich.'\n",
      "verse_text is:\"I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their share.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, \"Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward shall be very great.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abram said, \"O Lord GOD, what will You give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?\"\n",
      "verse_text is:And Abram said, \"Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, \"This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:And He took him outside and said, \"Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.\" And He said to him, \"So shall your descendants be.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness.\n",
      "verse_text is:And He said to him, \"I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:He said, \"O Lord GOD, how may I know that I will possess it?\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So He said to him, \"Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds.\n",
      "verse_text is:The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him.\n",
      "verse_text is:God said to Abram, \"Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces.\n",
      "verse_text is:On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, \"To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates:\n",
      "verse_text is:the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite\n",
      "verse_text is:and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim\n",
      "verse_text is:and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Sarai, Abram's wife had borne him no children, and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar.\n",
      "verse_text is:So Sarai said to Abram, \"Now behold, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go in to my maid; perhaps I will obtain children through her.\" And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.\n",
      "verse_text is:After Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Abram's wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife.\n",
      "verse_text is:He went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her sight.\n",
      "verse_text is:And Sarai said to Abram, \"May the wrong done me be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms, but when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her sight. May the LORD judge between you and me.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:But Abram said to Sarai, \"Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her what is good in your sight.\" So Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now the angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.\n",
      "verse_text is:He said, \"Hagar, Sarai's maid, where have you come from and where are you going?\" And she said, \"I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the angel of the LORD said to her, \"Return to your mistress, and submit yourself to her authority.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Moreover, the angel of the LORD said to her, \"I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:The angel of the LORD said to her further, \"Behold, you are with child, And you will bear a son; And you shall call his name Ishmael, Because the LORD has given heed to your affliction.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be against everyone, And everyone's hand will be against him; And he will live to the east of all his brothers.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, \"You are a God who sees\"; for she said, \"Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.\n",
      "verse_text is:So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, \"I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be blameless.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"I will establish My covenant between Me and you, And I will multiply you exceedingly.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying,\n",
      "verse_text is:\"As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you will be the father of a multitude of nations.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"No longer shall your name be called Abram, But your name shall be Abraham; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come forth from you.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"I will give to you and to your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:God said further to Abraham, \"Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, a servant who is born in the house or who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your descendants.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"A servant who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall surely be circumcised; thus shall My covenant be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"But an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then God said to Abraham, \"As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, \"Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?\"\n",
      "verse_text is:And Abraham said to God, \"Oh that Ishmael might live before You!\"\n",
      "verse_text is:But God said, \"No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:When He finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all the servants who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the very same day, as God had said to him.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n",
      "verse_text is:And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n",
      "verse_text is:In the very same day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son.\n",
      "verse_text is:All the men of his household, who were born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day.\n",
      "verse_text is:When he lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth,\n",
      "verse_text is:and said, \"My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass Your servant by.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree;\n",
      "verse_text is:and I will bring a piece of bread, that you may refresh yourselves; after that you may go on, since you have visited your servant.\" And they said, \"So do, as you have said.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, \"Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it and make bread cakes.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a tender and choice calf and gave it to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it.\n",
      "verse_text is:He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and placed it before them; and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then they said to him, \"Where is Sarah your wife?\" And he said, \"There, in the tent.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:He said, \"I will surely return to you at this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.\" And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing.\n",
      "verse_text is:Sarah laughed to herself, saying, \"After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\"\n",
      "verse_text is:And the LORD said to Abraham, \"Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, when I am so old?'\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Sarah denied it however, saying, \"I did not laugh\"; for she was afraid. And He said, \"No, but you did laugh.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the men rose up from there, and looked down toward Sodom; and Abraham was walking with them to send them off.\n",
      "verse_text is:The LORD said, \"Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,\n",
      "verse_text is:since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed?\n",
      "verse_text is:\"For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:And the LORD said, \"The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"I will go down now, and see if they have done entirely according to its outcry, which has come to Me; and if not, I will know.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham was still standing before the LORD.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham came near and said, \"Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So the LORD said, \"If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place on their account.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:And Abraham replied, \"Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord, although I am but dust and ashes.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five, will You destroy the whole city because of five?\" And He said, \"I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:He spoke to Him yet again and said, \"Suppose forty are found there?\" And He said, \"I will not do it on account of the forty.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then he said, \"Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?\" And He said, \"I will not do it if I find thirty there.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:And he said, \"Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord; suppose twenty are found there?\" And He said, \"I will not destroy it on account of the twenty.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then he said, \"Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once; suppose ten are found there?\" And He said, \"I will not destroy it on account of the ten.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his place.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.\n",
      "verse_text is:And he said, \"Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.\" They said however, \"No, but we shall spend the night in the square.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Yet he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.\n",
      "verse_text is:Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;\n",
      "verse_text is:and they called to Lot and said to him, \"Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him,\n",
      "verse_text is:and said, \"Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do nothing to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:But they said, \"Stand aside.\" Furthermore, they said, \"This one came in as an alien, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them.\" So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door.\n",
      "verse_text is:But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.\n",
      "verse_text is:They struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the doorway.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the two men said to Lot, \"Whom else have you here? A son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place;\n",
      "verse_text is:for we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy it.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, \"Up, get out of this place, for the LORD will destroy the city.\" But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be jesting.\n",
      "verse_text is:When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, \"Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:But he hesitated. So the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, for the compassion of the LORD was upon him; and they brought him out, and put him outside the city.\n",
      "verse_text is:When they had brought them outside, one said, \"Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the valley; escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:But Lot said to them, \"Oh no, my lords!\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Now behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your lovingkindness, which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, for the disaster will overtake me and I will die;\n",
      "verse_text is:now behold, this town is near enough to flee to, and it is small. Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) that my life may be saved.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:He said to him, \"Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there.\" Therefore the name of the town was called Zoar.\n",
      "verse_text is:The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven,\n",
      "verse_text is:and He overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.\n",
      "verse_text is:But his wife, from behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Abraham arose early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the LORD;\n",
      "verse_text is:and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace.\n",
      "verse_text is:Thus it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.\n",
      "verse_text is:Lot went up from Zoar, and stayed in the mountains, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the firstborn said to the younger, \"Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of the earth.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him that we may preserve our family through our father.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.\n",
      "verse_text is:On the following day, the firstborn said to the younger, \"Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve our family through our father.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.\n",
      "verse_text is:Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.\n",
      "verse_text is:The firstborn bore a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.\n",
      "verse_text is:As for the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negev, and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he sojourned in Gerar.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham said of Sarah his wife, \"She is my sister.\" So Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.\n",
      "verse_text is:But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, \"Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is married.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, \"Lord, will You slay a nation, even though blameless?\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then God said to him in the dream, \"Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also kept you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Now therefore, restore the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So Abimelech arose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were greatly frightened.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, \"What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:And Abimelech said to Abraham, \"What have you encountered, that you have done this thing?\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham said, \"Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Besides, she actually is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife;\n",
      "verse_text is:and it came about, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This is the kindness which you will show to me: everywhere we go, say of me, \"He is my brother.\"'\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abimelech then took sheep and oxen and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abimelech said, \"Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:To Sarah he said, \"Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is your vindication before all who are with you, and before all men you are cleared.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, so that they bore children.\n",
      "verse_text is:For the LORD had closed fast all the wombs of the household of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised.\n",
      "verse_text is:So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.\n",
      "verse_text is:Sarah said, \"God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:And she said, \"Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.\n",
      "verse_text is:Therefore she said to Abraham, \"Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall not be an heir with my son Isaac.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son.\n",
      "verse_text is:But God said to Abraham, \"Do not be distressed because of the lad and your maid; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"And of the son of the maid I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba.\n",
      "verse_text is:When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, \"Do not let me see the boy die.\" And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept.\n",
      "verse_text is:God heard the lad crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, \"What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.\n",

      "verse_text is:Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink.\n",
      "verse_text is:God was with the lad, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer.\n",
      "verse_text is:He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now it came about at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, \"God is with you in all that you do;\n",
      "verse_text is:now therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but according to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham said, \"I swear it.\"\n",

      "verse_text is:Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n",

      "verse_text is:He said, \"You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there the two of them took an oath.\n",
      "verse_text is:So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.\n",
      "verse_text is:And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, \"Abraham!\" And he said, \"Here I am.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:He said, \"Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.\n",
      "verse_text is:On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham said to his young men, \"Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.\n",
      "verse_text is:Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, \"My father!\" And he said, \"Here I am, my son.\" And he said, \"Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham said, \"God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\" So the two of them walked on together.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then they came to the place of which God had told him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.\n",
      "verse_text is:But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, \"Abraham, Abraham!\" And he said, \"Here I am.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:He said, \"Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the place of his son.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham called the name of that place The LORD Will Provide, as it is said to this day, \"In the mount of the LORD it will be provided.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven,\n",
      "verse_text is:and said, \"By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son,\n",
      "verse_text is:indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham lived at Beersheba.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now it came about after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, \"Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:\n",
      "verse_text is:Uz his firstborn and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of Aram\n",
      "verse_text is:and Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Bethuel became the father of Rebekah; these eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.\n",
      "verse_text is:His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.\n",
      "verse_text is:Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.\n",
      "verse_text is:Then Abraham rose from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,\n",
      "verse_text is:\"I am a stranger and a sojourner among you; give me a burial site among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:The sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,\n",
      "verse_text is:\"Hear us, my lord, you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave for burying your dead.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So Abraham rose and bowed to the people of the land, the sons of Heth.\n",
      "verse_text is:And he spoke with them, saying, \"If it is your wish for me to bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and approach Ephron the son of Zohar for me,\n",
      "verse_text is:that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns, which is at the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in your presence for a burial site.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth; even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,\n",
      "verse_text is:\"No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:And Abraham bowed before the people of the land.\n",
      "verse_text is:He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, \"If you will only please listen to me; I will give the price of the field, accept it from me that I may bury my dead there.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,\n",
      "verse_text is:\"My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? So bury your dead.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, commercial standard.\n",
      "verse_text is:So Ephron's field, which was in Machpelah, which faced Mamre, the field and cave which was in it, and all the trees which were in the field, that were within all the confines of its border, were deeded over\n",
      "verse_text is:to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.\n",
      "verse_text is:After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "verse_text is:So the field and the cave that is in it, were deeded over to Abraham for a burial site by the sons of Heth.\n",
      "verse_text is:Now Abraham was old, advanced in age; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in every way.\n",
      "verse_text is:Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he owned, \"Please place your hand under my thigh,\n",
      "verse_text is:and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live,\n",
      "verse_text is:but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:The servant said to him, \"Suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?\"\n",
      "verse_text is:Then Abraham said to him, \"Beware that you do not take my son back there!\n",
      "verse_text is:\"The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, 'To your descendants I will give this land,' He will send His angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.\n",
      "verse_text is:\"But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this my oath; only do not take my son back there.\"\n",
      "verse_text is:So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.\n"
