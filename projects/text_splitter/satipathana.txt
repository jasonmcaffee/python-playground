Holy Appreciation Note

There are five treasures rarely revealed in the world and
beyond compare, namely, the Tathagata; one able to teach the
Tathagata-declared Dhamma-discipline; one able to recognize the
teaching of the Tathagata-declared Dhamma-discipline; one who steps
his way in Dhamma by Dhamma, recognizing the teaching of the
Tathagata-declared Dhamma-discipline ; and a person grateful and
thankful.

Dhammas as declared and authorized by the Tathagata are
all for tranquility and cessation of birth, aging and death so that all
beings attain the stage of liberation.

My appreciation to the editor team of this book on
Buddhawajana - Anapanasati, who have helped to continue the good
dhamma practice by spreading the teachings of the Buddha's own
words. Such is an act conducive to the development and cultivation
of the Saddadhamma. With this good deeds, may all who are involved
in the publishing of this book and all who read and put these teachings
into practice be gifted with an opportunity to achieve liberation and
reach the land of the Deathless in this very life.

May all be developed in the dhammas,
Venerable Ajahn Kukrit Sotthibalo

Preface

If there were rankings of world's most
important books, this book on Anapanasati by the
Tathagata should have been one among the top
rankings.

Words of the Buddha in regard to Anapanasati
(mindfulness of breathing), when considered in
conjunction with the principle of "Dependent
Origination", is notably a practice to minimize the
frequency of mind phenomena, which is conducive
to the attainment of true knowledge.

The Tathagata in his teaching addressed
that Anapanasati shall fulfil the four establishments
of mindfulness, which then fulfil the seven
enlightenment factors, leading to true knowledge
and liberation. These could have been achieved in
one single in-breathing-and-out-breathing,
providing one practices in accordance with the
teaching of the Tathagata, the enlightened one.



For all being who possesses the ability to
attain true knowledge, this would be one book worth
studying because the book contains details of the
suttas of the Buddha's own words in all aspects
with regard to Anapanasati.

This book would probably be the first guide
to liberation from sufferings by developing
Anapanasati based on teachings from the Buddha's
own words and not from those of his disciples (which
often include portions of the original Buddha's
teachings with additions of ones' own that could
sometime be misleading.)

It has been quite an effort in compiling the
suttas in order to publish this book on Anapanasati.
However, it has been apparent in his teachings that
the Tathagata established Anapanasati as a
"pleasant dwelling" and said of the many fruits and
benefits of Anapanasati.



Among dhamma practitioners, Anapanasati
is widely taught and learnt. Unfortunately, with
the additions of the words of the disciples, the
practice adopted by many has strayed off from the
original teachings of the Buddha.

Hence, for those to develop Anapanasati
rightly, one thing that may be necessary is to
undertake a re-education, that is to learn the
original teachings from the Buddha's own words.
As for new practitioners, this is an opportunity to
learn rightly from the original teachings of the
Buddha. In doing so, one could be bound for true
knowledge and liberation.

Faithful Followers of the Tathagata



Note for the English Version.

This book on Anapanasati is first published
in Thai for a non-commercial purpose, but for free
distribution to all interested Buddhist practioners .

The Thai version has been very well received
by the Buddhist practitioners in Thailand and
overseas, prompting a request for the book in an
English version for non-Thai practioners. That was
the beginning of an effort by Watnahpapong to work
on this book in English.

In compiling the suttas in English, reference
has been made to the various sources of the English
translation of the Tipitaga available, all of which are
noted in accordance with each individual sutta.

Like the Thai version of the book, this book
on Anapanasati is published for a non- commercial
purpose and is to be distributed to all interested for

Two Great Benefits of
Anapanasati

"Bhikkhus, mindfulness of breathing,
when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit
and benefit. And how, bhikkhus, is mindfulness
of breathing developed and cultivated so that it
is of great fruit and benefit?

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having
gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or an
empty hut, sits down. Having folded his legs
crosswise, straightened his body, and set up
mindfulness in front of him, just mindful he
breathes in, mindful he breathes out.

"Breathing in long, he knows: "I
breathe in long'; or breathing out long, he
knows: 'I breathe out long.'

Mindfulness of breathing fulfills

the four foundations

of mindfulness, the seven

enlightenment factors, and the

true knowledge and deliverance.

"Bhikkhus, I am content with this
progress. My mind is content with this progress.
So arouse still more energy to attain the
unattained, to achieve the unachieved, to realise
the unrealised. I shall wait here at Savatthi for
the Komudi full moon of the fourth month."

The bhikkhus of the countryside
heard: "the Blessed One will wait there for the
Komudi full moon of the fourth month." And the
bhikkhus of the countryside left in due course
for Savatthi to see the Blessed One.

Many very well-known elder disciples

Moggallana, the venerable Maha Kassapa,
the venerable Maha Kaccana, the venerable
Maha Kotthita, the venerable Maha Kappina,
the venerable Maha Cunda, the venerable
Anuruddha, the venerable Revata, the venerable
Ananda, and other very well-known elder
disciples- intensively taught and instructed
new bhikkhus; some elder bhikkhus taught
and instructed ten new bhikkhus, some elder
bhikkhus taught and instructed twenty... thirty...
forty new bhikkhus. And the new bhikkhus,
taught and instructed by the elder bhikkhus, had
achieved successive stages of high distinction.

On that occasion, the Uposatha day of
the fifteenth, the full-moon night of the Komudi
full moon of the fourth month, the Blessed One
.... addressed them thus:

"Bhikkhus, this assembly is free from
prattle, this assembly is free from chatter. It
consists purely of heartwood. Such is this
Sangha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly.

gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of
offerings, worthy of reverential salutation,

given to it becomes great and a great gift
greater- such is this Sangha of bhikkhus, such

world to see - such is this Sangha of bhikkhus,
such is this assembly.

journeying many leagues with a travel-bag

to see - such is this Sangha of bhikkhus, such is
this assembly.

are bhikkhus who are arahants with taints
destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done
what had to be done, laid down the burden,



28 Buddhawajana (Document to be used with this lecture only)



reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of
being, and are completely liberated through
final knowledge - such bhikkhus are there in
this Sangha of bhikkhus.

"In this Sangha of bhikkhus there
are bhikkhus who, with the destruction of
the five lower fetters, are due to reappear
spontaneously (in the Pure Abode) and there
attain final Nibbana, without ever returning
from that world - such bhikkhus are there in
this Sangha of bhikkhus.

"In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are
bhikkhus who, with the destruction of three
fetters and with the attenuation of lust, hate, and
delusion, are once-returners, returning once to

Mindfulness of breathing

(according to Satipatthana Sutta)

"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu
abide contemplating the body as a body?

Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to
the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down;
having folded his legs crosswise, set his body
erect, and established mindfulness in front of
him, ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he
breathes out.

(1) Breathing in long, he understands: 'I
breathe in long'; or breathing out long, he
understands: 'I breathe out long.'

(2) Breathing in short, he understands: 'I
breathe in short'; or breathing out short, he
understands: 'I breathe out short.'

(3) He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in
experiencing the whole body' ; he trains thus:
'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole
body'.



46 Bllddhawajana (Document to be used with this lecture only)

(4) He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in
tranquillizing the bodily formation'; he

trains thus: 'I shall breathe out tranquillizing
the bodily formation.' Just as a skilled turner
or his apprentice, when making a long turn,
understands: 'I make a long turn'; or, when
making a short turn, understands: 'I make a
short turn';

"In this way he abides contemplating
the body as a body internally, or he abides
contemplating the body as a body externally,
or he abides contemplating the body as a body
both internally and externally. Or else he abides
contemplating in the body its arising factors,
or he abides contemplating in the body its
vanishing factors, or he abides contemplating
in the body both its arising and vanishing
factors. Or else mindfulness that 'there is
a body' is simply established in him to the
extent necessary for bare knowledge and
mindfulness. And he abides independent, not
clinging to anything in the world.

That is how a bhikkhu abides
contemplating the body as a body."

of breathing is developing

mindfulness of the body.

Having folded his legs crosswise, set his body
erect, and established mindfulness in front of
him, ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he
breathes out:

understands: 'I breathe out long.'

"Breathing in short, he understands:
'I breathe in short'; or breathing out short, he

"He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in

'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole
body.

"He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in

trains thus: 'I shall breathe out tranquillising

"As he abides thus diligent, ardent, and
resolute, his memories and intentions based
on the household life are abandoned; with
their abandoning his mind becomes steadied
internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated.

"That is how a bhikkhu develops
mindfulness of the body."

Understanding feelings.

"When, bhikkhus, the concentration by
mindfulness of breathing has been developed
and cultivated in this way, if he feels a pleasant
feeling, he understands: 'It is impermanent'; he
understands: 'It is not held to'; he understands:
'It is not delighted in.'

"If he feels a painful feeling,

he understands: 'It is impermanent'; he

understands: 'It is not held to'; he understands:
'It is not delighted in.'

"If he feels a neither-painful-nor-

pleasant feeling, he understands: 'It is
impermanent'; he understands: 'It is not held
to'; he understands: 'It is not delighted in.'

"If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels
it detached; if he feels a painful feeling, he
feels it detached; if he feels a neither-painful
nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached.

"When he feels a feeling terminating

with the body, he understands: 'I feel a feeling
terminating with the body.'

"When he feels a feeling terminating

with life, he understands: 'I feel a feeling
terminating with life.'

"He understands: 'With the breakup
of the body, following the exhaustion of life,
all that is felt, not being delighted in, will
become cool right here.'

"Just as, bhikkhus, an oil lamp burns
in dependence on the oil and the wick, and
with the exhaustion of the oil and the wick it
is extinguished through lack of fuel."

"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu
feels a feeling terminating with the body, he
understands: 'I feel a feeling terminating with
the body. ' When he feels a feeling terminating
with life, he understands: 'I feel a feeling
terminating with life .' He understands : ' With the
breakup of the body, following the exhaustion
of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in,
will become cool right here.'"

To practice mindfulness of
breathing is to abide to jhana.

"Monks, if even for the lasting of a
finger-snap a bhikku should practice the
mindfulness of breathing.

"One who (does) is called a monk

"He is one whose musing is not fruitless.
He abides doing the Master's bidding. He takes
advice and eats the country's alms-food to some
purpose.

make much of (all) these things?"

Mindfulness of breathing : pleasant

dwelling and quelling of evil

wholesome states.

(...The Blessed One. ...addressed the
Venerable Ananda: "Why, Ananda, does
the Bhikkhu Sangha look so diminished?"
"Venerable sir, that is because... those bhikkhus,
thinking: the Blessed One was giving a talk
on foulness in many ways, was speaking in
praise of foulness, was speaking in praise
of the development of foulness meditation:
dwelt devoted to the development of foulness
meditation in its many aspects and factors.
Being repelled, humiliated, and disgusted with
this body, they sought for an assailant. In one
day ten bhikkhus used the knife, or in one
day twenty or thirty bhikkhus used the knife.

It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed
One would explain another method so that this
Bhikkhu Sangha may be established in final
knowledge."....

Then the Blessed One ..addressed the
bhikkhus thus:

"Bhikkhus, this concentration by
mindfulness of breathing, when developed
and cultivated, is peaceful and sublime, an
ambrosial pleasant dwelling, and it disperses
and quells right on the spot evil unwholesome
states whenever they arise.

"Just as, bhikkhus, in the last month of
the hot season, when a mass of dust and dirt
has swirled up, a great rain cloud out of season
disperses it and quells it on the spot, so too
concentration by mindfulness of breathing,
when developed and cultivated, is peaceful
and sublime, an ambrosial pleasant dwelling,
and it disperses and quells on the spot evil
unwholesome states whenever they arise. And
how is this so?

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having
gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to

an empty hut, sits down. Having folded his
legs crosswise, straightened his body, and set
up mindfulness in front of him, just mindful he
breathes in, mindful he breathes out.

"Breathing in long, he knows: 'I breathe
in long'; or breathing out long, he knows: 'I
breathe out long.'

"Breathing in short, he knows: 'I
breathe in short'; or breathing out short, he
knows: 'I breathe out short.'

associated with trouble exists not.

(3) In those who dwell observant of

mindful of breathing in and out, seeing the
calm of all compounded things and ever

restraint of the Obligations; he will be perfect
in behaviour andhabitude, seeing danger in the
smallest fault; and will undertake the traing, he
will train himself accordantly

who has a good friend, companion, comrade:
such talk as is serious and a help to opening
the heart-that is to say, talk on wanting little,
on contentment, on loneliness, on going
apart, on strenuous endeavour, on virtue, on
concentration, on wisdom, on emancipation, on
the knowledge and vision of emancipation - he
will obtain at will, easily -and without difficulty

"Moreover, this may be expected of
a monk, who has a good friend, companion,

comrade: he will dwell strenuous in purpose,
putting away unrighteous conditions, taking to
righteousness; persevering and energetic, and
will not shirk the burden of righteousness.

"And (this may be expected of a monk,
who has a good friend, companion, comrade:)
he will have wisdom and is endowed therewith
as to the way of growth and decay, and Ariyan
penetration concerning the way to the utter
destruction of ill."

amity must be made to become, to put away
ill-will; mindfulness in in-breathing and out-

Conditions conducive to the
ripening.

"..For the emancipation of the mind
of the unripe, five conditions, Meghiya, are
conductive to the ripening. What five?

1 . "Herein, Meghiya, a monk has a good
friend, a good companion, a good comrade.
For the emancipation of the mind of the unripe,
this is the first conductive to the ripening.

2. "Again, a monk is virtuous and dwells
restrained by the restraint of the obligations ;
he is perfect in behaviour and habitude, seeing
danger in the smallest fault; he undertakes the
training. This is the second condition.

3. "Then that talk which is serious and
a help to opening the heart: talk on wanting
little, on contentmenfon loneliness, on going
apart, on strenuous endeavour, on virtue, on



1 1 Buddhawajana (Document to be used with this lecture only)



concentration, on wisdom, on emancipation,
onthe knowledge and vision of emancipation,
he obtains at will. This is the third condition.

4. "Then a monk dwells strenuous in

purpose, putting away unrighteous conditions,
taking to righteousness; persevering and
energetic and shirks not the burden of
righteousness. This is the forth condition.

5. "Moreover a monk has wisdom and
is endowed therewith as to the way of growth
and decay, and Ariyan penetration concerning
the way to the utter destruction of ill. This is the
fifth condition conductive to the ripening."

"These. ..conditions... Meghiya, maybe
expected of a monk who has a good friend, a
good companion, a good comrade."

"Then, Meghiya, when that monk is
established in those five conditions, four more
must be made to become by him:

1. "Reflection on foul things, to put

away passion;

2. "On amity, to put away ill-will;

3. "Mindfulness in inhaling and
exhaling, to cut off distraction; and

4. "The thought of impermanence, to
uproot the conceit 'I am.' For a monk, Meghiya,
who thinks on impermanence, the thought
of not-self endures; thinking on there being
no-self endures; thinking on there being no
self, he wins to the state wherein the conceit
'I am' has been uprooted, to the cool, even in
this life."

The Ten Ideas as grounds for
sickness to be disallayed.

"If you, Ananda, were to visit the monk
Girimananda and recite to him the Ten Ideas,
there are grounds for supposing that when he
hears them that sickness will be allayed there
and then. What are the Ten Ideas?

"The idea of (im)permanence, of
not-self, of the foul, of the disadvantage,
abandoning, revulsion, fading, distaste for all
the world, of impermanence in all compounds,
of concentration on in-breathing and out-
breathing.

"And what, Ananda, is the idea of
impermanence?

"Herein a monk who has gone to the
forest or the root of a tree or a lonely place thus



(Document to be used with this lecture only) Anapanasati 113



contemplates: impermanent is objective form,
impermanent are feelings, ideas, compounded
things, impermanent is consciousness. Thus
he abides seeing impermanence in the five
grasping-heaps. This is called 'the idea of
impermanence.'

"And what, Ananda, is the idea of not-
self?

"Herein a monk who has gone to the
forest or the root of a tree or a lonely place thus
contemplates: The eye is not the self, objective
form is not the self, the ear and sounds . . . nose
and scents . . . tongue and tastes . . . body and
tangibles . . . mind and mind-states are not the
self. Thus he abides not seeing the self in those
six outer and inner spheres. This, Ananda, is
called 'the idea of not-self.'

"And what, Ananda, is the idea of the
foul?

"Herein a monk examines just this body,



1 1 4 Buddhawajana (Document to be used with this lecture only)



upwards from the soles of the feet, downwards
from the top of the head, enclosed by skin, full
of manifold impurities (and concludes): There
are in this body hair of the head, hair of the
body, nails, skin, teeth, flesh, nerves, bones,
marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen,
lungs, intestines, bowels, stomach, freces, bile,
phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, serum,
spittle, mucus, nose-mucus, synovial fluid,
urine. Thus he abides observant of the foul in
body. This, Ananda, is called 'the idea of the
foul.'

"And what, Ananda, is the idea of the
disadvantage?

"Herein a monk who has gone to the
forest or the root of a tree or a lonely place
thus contemplates: This body has many ills,
many disadvantages. Thus, in this body arise
divers diseases, such as disease of eyesight and
hearing, of nose, tongue, trunk, head, ear, mouth,
teeth; there is cough, asthma, catarrh, fever,
decrepitude, belly-ache, swooning, dysentery,



(Document to be used with this lecture only) Anapanasati 115



griping, cholera, leprosy, imposthume, eczema,
phthisis, epilepsy; skin-disease, itch, scab,
tetter, scabies; bile-in-the-blood (jaundice),
diabetes, piles, boils, ulcers; diseases arising
from bile, from phlegm, from wind, from the
union of bodily humours, from changes of the
seasons, from stress of circumstances, or from
the ripeness of one's karma; also cold and heat,
hunger and thirst, evacuation and urination.
Thus he abides observant of the disadvantages
in this body. This, Ananda, is called 'the idea
of the disadvantage.'

"And what, Ananda, is the idea of
abandoning?

"Herein a monk admits not sensual
thinking that has arisen, but abandons,
restrains, makes an end of it, forces it not to
recur. He admits not malicious thinking . . .
harmful thinking . . . evil, unprofitable states
that arise from time to time, but abandons,
restrains, makes an end of them, forces them



1 1 6 Buddhawajana (Document to be used with this lecture only)



not to recur. This, Ananda, is called 'the idea
of abandoning.'

"And what, Ananda, is the idea of
revulsion?

"Herein a monk who has gone to the
forest or the root of a tree or a lonely place
thus contemplates: This is the real, this is
the excellent, namely, the calming of all the
activities, the casting off of every basis, the
destruction of craving, revulsion, nibbana. This,
Ananda, is called 'The idea of revulsion.'

"And what is the idea of ending?

"Herein a monk who has gone to the
forest or the root of a tree or a lonely place
thus contemplates: This is the real, this is
the excellent, namely, the calming of all the
activities, the casting off of every basis, the
destruction of craving, ending, nibbana. This,
Ananda, is called 'the idea of ending.'

"And what, Ananda, is the idea of



(Document to be used with this lecture only) Anapanasati 117



distaste?

"Herein a monk, by abandoning, by not
clinging to those grasping of systems, those
mental standpoints and dogmatic bias that are
in the world, delights not therein. This is called
'the idea of distaste.'

"And what, Ananda, is the idea of
impermanence?

"Herein a monk is troubled by, ashamed
of and disgusted with all compounded things.
This is called 'the idea of impermanence (in
all compounds).'

"And what, Ananda, is the idea of
concentration on in-breathing and out-
breathing?

"Herein a monk who has gone to the
forest or the root of a tree or a lonely place, sits
down crosslegged, holding the body upright
and setting mindfulness in front of him. He
breathes in mindfully and mindfully breathes
out.

Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out'.

"He puts into practice the intention:

Contemplating ending I shall breathe out'.

"He puts into practice the intention:

"This, Ananda, is called 'the idea of

"Now, Ananda, if you were to visit the
monk Girimananda and recite to him these
Ten Ideas, there is ground for supposing that
on his hearing them that sickness of his will

straightway be allayed."

Thereupon the venerable Ananda
having got by heart these Ten Ideas in the
presence of the Exalted One, visited the
venerable Girimananda and recited them. On
his hearing them that sickness of the venerable
Girimananda was straightway allayed, and
he rose up from that sickness. And in this way
that sickness was banished from the venerable
Girimananda.

Hindrances which overspread
the heart.

"There are, monks, these five checks,
hindrances, which overspread the heart, which
weaken insight. What five?

1. "Sensual desire, monks, is a check, a
hindrance, which overspreads the heart, which
weaken insight;

2. "Ill-will, monks, is a check, a
hindrance, which overspreads the heart, which
weakens insight;

3. "Sloth and torpor, monks, is a check,
a hindrance which overspreads the heart, which
weakens insight;

4. "Flurry and worry, momks, is a check,
a hindrance, which overspreads the heart, which

weakens insight;

5. "Doubt, monks, is a check, a
hindrance, which overspreads the heart, which
weakens insight."...

"Monks, that a monk, verily without
being rid of those five checks, hindrances,
which overspread the heart, which weaken
insight, shall know his own good, shall know
another's good, shall know the good of both, or
shall realize the excellence of knowledge and
insight proper to Ariyans, which goes beyond
man's conditions—that cannot be."

"Monks, suppose in the case of a
mountain stream, winding here and there,
swiftly flowing, taking all along with it, a man
were to open watercourses into it from both
sides; then indeed, monks, the flow in mid-
stream would be disturbed; swirled about and
diverted, nor would the stream wind here and
there, nor flow swiftly, nor take all along with
it;

(Then, the Tathagata addressed of the opposite
that a monk, being rid of these five checks,

a man were to close the watercourses on both
sides of it,. ..the stream would would not be

Hindrances- obstacles to
concentration.

"It is as if the River Aciravati were
brimful of water so that a crow could drink

cross over and were to lie down on this bank,
covering his head with a shawl. What do you
think, Vasettha ? Would that man be able to get
to the other side?"

'Wo, Reverend Gotama."

"In just the same way, Vasettha, in the
Ariyan discipline these five hindrances are
called obstacles, hindrances, coverings-up,
enveloping. Which fives?

"The hindrance of sensuality, of ill-
will, of sloth-and-torpor, of worry-and-
flurry, of doubt.

Disciplines in cultivating the four
establishment of mindfulness.

"When, Aggivessana, the noble disciple
possesses mindfulness and full awareness,
then the Tathagata disciplines him further:
'Come, bhikkhu, resort to a secluded resting
place: forest, the root of a tree, a mountain,
a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground,
a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of
straw.' He resorts to a secluded resting place:
the forest... a heap of straw. On returning from
his almsround, after his meal he sits down,
folding his legs crosswise, setting his body
erect, and establishing mindfulness before him.
Abandoning covetousness for the world, he
abides with a mind free from covetousness;
he purifies his mind from covetousness.
Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides
with a mind free from ill will, compassionate
for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies
his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning



1 36 Buddhawajana (Document to be used with this lecture only)



sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth
and. torpor, percipient of light, mindful, and
fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and
torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse,

he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly
peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness
and remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides
having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about
wholesome states; he purifies his mind from
doubt.

"Having thus abandoned these five
hindrances, imperfections of the mind that
weaken wisdom, he abides contemplating the
body as a body... feelings as feelings... mind
as mind... mind-objects as mind-objects,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put
away covetousness and grief for the world....

"Then the Tathagata disciplines him
further: 'Come, bhlkkhu, abide contemplating
the body as a body but do not think thoughts
connected with the body;

"Abide contemplating feelings as
feelings but do not think thoughts connected
with feelings;



(Document to be used with this lecture only) Anapanasati 137



"Abide contemplating mind as mind
but do not think thoughts connected with the
mind;

"Abide contemplating mind-objects

"With the stilling of applied and
sustained thought, he enters upon and abides
in the second jhana which has self-confidence
and singleness of mind without applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure
born of concentration.

(the Blessed One then taught about the third
jhana ... the fourth jhana. . . the knowledge of
recollection of the past lives... the knowledge
of the passing away and reappearance of
beings... the knowledge of the destruction
of the taints... until the liberation, similar to
suttas relevant to these matters. )

Buddhakos Foundation

Foundation of Buddhists who are firm and true
to the Buddha's words.

It began with a small group of Buddhists who had the oppor-
tunity to hear the dhamma talks of Venerable Ajahn Kukrit Sotthibalo
who emphasizes the Buddhawajana (the teachings and disciplines of
the Buddha's own words -Dhammavinaya, proclaimed by the Buddha
to be complete and pure in context and letters) in his teachings, truly
reflecting how dhammas are to be taught according to the disciplines
of Buddhism addressed by the Tathagata to the first sixty Arahant
disciples at the Deer Park in Isipatana, a common approach strictly
followed by all disciples during the Buddha's time.

The Buddhawajana has yielded answers to doubts and
clarity to confusions over various dhamma teachings prevailing
among Buddhist communities, all arising from one common cause,
that is the teaching and learning, to begin with, are not based on
the Buddha's words.

With an unwavering respect in the Buddha, the Enlightened
One, as the highest master, Ven. Ajahn Kukrit has publicly declared
that "I do not have teachings of my own". Hence, dedicating all his time
to serving the Buddha's course by spreading the Buddhawajana for the
firm rooting of the Saddadhamma and the unity of all Buddhists.

By returning to the Buddhawajana as in the Buddha's time,
there appears clarity and seamless linkages in knowledge and under-
standing in the dhamma principles through to the noble paths which
are direct and achievable when practiced, with fruit that can be verified
by self. As a result, there is an ever-growing number of Buddhists who
value the Buddha's words, creating a "Buddhawajana Stream" - a quiet
force that could become a new wave to bring back the rightful way of
learning dhamma similar to that in the Buddha's time.



With the growth of the Buddhawajana Stream, Buddhawa-
jana materials, being books or CDs, which are produced and dis-
tributed for free to the public have become of shortage because the
number of interested public has grown rapidly. Ven. Ajahn Kukrit,
however, has strictly followed the Buddhism disciplines drawn di-
rectly from the Buddha's words and spread the Buddhawajana in the
most humble way based purely on the resources available through
donations of faithful Buddhist followers only, which at times can be
limited.

Since the obligation in creating a firm rooting for the Saddad-
hamma does not rest only with the Buddhist Sangha, a group of lay fol-
lowers who recognize the importance of the Buddhawajana has gathered
together for the task of supporting the work of Ven. Ajahn Kukrit in
spreading the Buddhawajana. It has led to a decision to register as a
lawful foundation to carry out activities in a manner that is transparent
and open as well as open to the Buddhist public.

For one who sees the importance of the Buddhawajana and
wishes to see the firm rooting of the Saddadhamma by way of the
Buddha's words, support can be lent simply by truly adhering to the
learning and cultivating dhamma practices of the Buddhawajana. In
doing so, one shall experience for self the noble paths as taught in
the Buddha's own words, which shall lead to one's true knowledge
in the ever-logical and interconnected dhammas of the Buddha and
the realization of the fruit and the development of a faith in the
spreading of the Buddha's words. Such is already sufficient for one
to contribute as a unit of the "Buddhakos".

This is the objective of the Buddhakos Foundation, that
is to be the foundation of Buddhists who are firm and true to the
Buddha's words.
