This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.\n\nThe `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.\n\nIf an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.\n\nLike all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.</td>

For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.\n\nFor `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.\n\nNote that not all institutions calculate the `available`  balance.

For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.\n\nFor `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.\n\nNote that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update.
