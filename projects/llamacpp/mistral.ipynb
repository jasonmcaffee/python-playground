      " Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc², which has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a key piece of evidence for quantum theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Einstein's scientific work is also associated with the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. He was affiliated with the California Institute of Technology from 1933 until his death in 1955, holding the title of professor of theoretical physics. Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"genius\" synonymous with scientific profundity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Einstein's personal story is one of the great human dramas of science. He was a passionate advocate for peace, social justice, and freedom. He lived in Germany during the rise of the Nazis, and he left Germany after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 because of his Jewish heritage. Einstein's views on religion, politics, and science were complex and nuanced, and they continue to be a source of fascination and debate.\n",

      "Einstein is often remembered as a humorous and compassionate man who had a deep love for music and the arts. He was known for his unconventional appearance, including his wild hair and disheveled clothing, which made him stand out in the rigid and formal world of academia. Despite his fame and success, Einstein remained humble and dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge throughout his life.\n",

    "\n",
    "Built with Spring Boot and Kotlin, Bank-Core is engineered for resilience and scalability, ensuring that financial institutions can provide continuous, reliable service to their users. Spring Boot's convention-over-configuration paradigm significantly reduces development time and increases efficiency, making it an ideal choice for building microservices. Kotlin, on the other hand, brings in safety features, conciseness, and interoperability with Java, enhancing the robustness and maintainability of the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "System Architecture\n",
    "The architecture of Bank-Core is designed with modularity, scalability, and security at its core, leveraging several key technologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Framework: Spring Boot (Kotlin)\n",
    "Choosing Spring Boot for our framework allows for rapid development and deployment. Its embedded server, automatic configuration, and wide array of starter kits make it an unparalleled choice for microservice architecture. Kotlin enhances our service with its null safety, expressiveness, and functional programming capabilities, addressing common pitfalls in Java and significantly improving our codebase's safety and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Documentation: OpenAPI 3.0\n",
    "Documentation and client library generation are streamlined with OpenAPI 3.0, offering a clear, interactive API documentation. This not only aids developers in integrating with Bank-Core but also ensures our API's design is accessible and user-friendly. OpenAPI's support for security definitions and schema validation is critical in a domain where data integrity and security are paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database: PostgreSQL\n",
    "The choice of PostgreSQL as our database system is influenced by its robustness, ACID compliance, and support for complex queries and transactions.
